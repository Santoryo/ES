# Embedded Systems
This repository contains my tasks for Embedded Systems laboratory at university. It utilizes a self-written ```GPIODriver.h``` which final version will be uploaded in ```final``` directory. After grading the task I do not come back to old tasks.

This code was written for STM32L496ZGT6 and ran on KAmeLeon STM32L4 board.
